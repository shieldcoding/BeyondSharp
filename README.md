BeyondSharp
===========

BeyondSharp is an open-source platform initiative to take over some of the more cumbersome tasks when trying to develop a 2D networked game with limited resources or knowledge. The primary goal of this project is to take over the implementation of the network, sound, and graphics components of a game and allow a developer to focus on creating content instead. The BeyondSharp Server and Client share a common networking protocol and engine base, changes to the server's state will trigger messages to be sent to the client programs to update their game state accordingly.
